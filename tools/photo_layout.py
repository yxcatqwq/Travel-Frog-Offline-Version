"""Scenery placement for layered travel-photo templates.

The client renders a photo by pasting every layer as a bitmap at an absolute
top-left position inside a 500x350 frame (``Tabikaeru.getPictureTexture`` in
``main.min.js``: ``bitmap.x = layer[1]; bitmap.y = layer[2]``).  Those
coordinates came from the service; ``Picture.json`` only carries the layer
*names*, the character offsets and the front/back split.  The service table is
not part of the client package, so the scenery coordinates are reconstructed
here.

Reconstruction rules, in order of precedence:

1. ``SCENERY_POSITIONS[record_id][piece]`` - reviewed coordinates for a scene.
2. A layer whose artwork is already registered on a full 500x350 canvas is
   pasted at the canvas origin.
3. Artwork that is cut off by its own border must be flush with that border:
   ground bands sit on the canvas bottom, stalks and trunks that run out of the
   top of the crop are anchored to the top edge, wide backdrops are centred in
   the frame.  This is what the original layer rectangles look like once they
   are cut out of the master illustration.

Everything that stays ambiguous after those rules is listed explicitly in
``SCENERY_POSITIONS`` with the reviewed value.
